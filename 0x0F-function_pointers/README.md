Function pointers are used to call a particular function at runtime.

- A function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function 
that can be later called through that function pointer. This is useful 
because functions encapsulate behavior. For instance, everytime you 
need a particular behaviour such as calculating mathematical expressions,
instead of writing out a bunch of code, all you need to do is to call 
the function.
- Also you use it to choose different behaviours at different times 
in essentially the same piece of code.
