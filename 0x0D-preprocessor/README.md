0x0D C preproscessor and macros:

c preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the 
compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. 
All preprocessor commands begin with a # (hash symbol)

- basically the preprocessor gives instructions to the c program to fetch
some files before it does the final compilation.

eg. #include is a preprocessor used to include a header file.
